Plugin-utils
============

A bunch of helper to deal with assets inside plugins. This plugin provides
functions that one may reuse with his own plugins.


Example usage
=============

You have a cool plugin named 'cool_plugin' that contains assets (javascripts,
images, css) that should be accessable from the host application.

In your plugin (YOUR_APP/vendor/plugins/cool_plugin) create a folder called 'public'.
Inside this folder follow the normal Rails conventions for the applications'
public folder.

In your plugins init.rb 'install' these assets by simple calling:

  Provideal::PluginUtils.install_plugin_assets('cool_plugin')

This will create a proper symlink YOUR_APP/public/_plugins/cool_plugin to
YOUR_APP/vendor/plugins/cool_plugin/public.

To access this assets from your host application you can use Rails'
normal asset helper tags. This plugin provides the new ':plugin' option to these
methods.

Example:

  <%= javascript_include_tag('foo', :plugin => 'cool_plugin') %>

This will create a proper link to /_plugins/cool_plugin/javascripts/foo.js.

Have fun.
