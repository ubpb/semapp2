Provideal Plugin Utils
======================

A small collection of utilities to deal with assets bundled within Rails
plugins/engines.

The official homepgae is: http://github.com/provideal/provideal-plugin-utils

It provides two things. First it provides a method to install assets bundled
within a Rails plugin/engine into your host application (symlink into
/public/plugins/my_plugin).

Secondly it adds a :plugin option to Rails asset helper tags 'stylesheet_link_tag',
'javascript_include_tag', 'image_path' and 'image_tag'.

Example:

Suppose you have a JavaScript file called foo.js bundled with your plugin 'my_plugin'.
Using <%= javascript_include_tag 'foo.js', :plugin => 'my_plugin' %> will then create
the correct uri to that asset.

Installation
------------

sudo gem install provideal-plugin-utils -s http://gemcutter.org


Usage
-----

* Install the gem
* Make sure your plugins' assets are organized following Rails conventions
  (images in public/images, stylesheets in public/stylesheets etc).
* Trigger the installtion of your plugin assets with:

    Provideal::PluginUtils.install_assets('my_plugin', 'path to your plugins public folder')

  Example (called in init.rb):

    Provideal::PluginUtils.install_assets('my_plugin', File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'public')))


Known issues
------------

This version supports only symlinking the assets. As a result this version is
not supported on Windows.
